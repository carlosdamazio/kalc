# KalcOS
A kernel for a REPL calculator.

## Rationale
This is a toy project on how to build a Kernel to manage computing resources, not meant to be a full fledged production
one. Also this one is to sharpen my C skillzz. There will be a Rust version of this.

## Building and running
This is what you need in order to build and run this project:
- Qemu - Emulator for our Kernel.
- Nasm - Assembler to compile our .asm files.
- Gcc - The GNU Compiler Collection, to compile our .c files when we make the transition from Assembly to C.
- make - Automation tool to execute the compiling steps necessary to build the kernel.
- edk2-ovmf - OVMF shared libraries for executing UEFI applications in QEMU.
- cdrkit - Contains tool to create ISO files.

Using your favourite package manager, install these dependencies in order to get this thing running:
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S qemu nasm gcc make edk2-ovmf cdrkit
```
After that, clone the gnu-efi repository into the `boot/gnu-efi` folder and build its libraries.

```bash
$ mkdir boot
$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/gnu-efi/code boot/gnu-efi
```

Using `make`, build the boot loader and kernel by running. To get it running, run `make run` with sudo
because of the OVMF libraries being located in a folder owned by root:
```bash
$ make
$ sudo make run
```

This will generate the `KalcOS.iso` file in `build/` directory, of which is the image to be ran on QEMU.
